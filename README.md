### NMR in Porous Media (T<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>1</sub> relaxation, Laplace transform, and T<sub>2</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> exchange)
This section contains my work from my master's and PhD. I summarize information about NMR in Porous Media and share the codes for Laplace transform 1D and 2D, which are used in regular and filtered T<sub>2</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> Exchange.


### Steady-State Free Precession Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (SSFP-DMI)
This part contains my work from post-doctorate at the Weizmann Institute of Science/Israel. I summarize information about Steady-State Free Precession Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (SSFP-DMI) and share the codes and sequences for Laplace transform 1D and 2D used in regular and filtered T2-T2 Exchange.

### Steady-State Free Precession?

### What is Steady-State Free Precession Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (SSFP-DMI)?
If you don’t know what is Deuterium Metabolic Imaging, we suggest to read first [“What is Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (DMI)?”](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/dmi/) from Yale School of Medicine.
